Site created for Hotel Mascotas. I created this site using tailwind, hyperUI library with UI components, react and typescript. These two last ones were not necessary but I preffered do use them over plain JS, HTML and CSS.

## Installation process with npm

Run these two commands in terminal after going into project directory

### `npm install`

### `npm start`
